Generate coarse-grained molecular dynamics models from atomistic trajectories.

The aim of this project is to provide a tool to aid in parametrising coarse-grained (CG) molecular mechanics models.
PyCGTOOL generates coarse-grained models from atomistic simulation trajectories using a user-provided mapping. 
Equilibrium values and force constants of bonded terms are calculated by Boltzmann Inversion of bond distributions collected from the input trajectory.

Alternatively map-only mode (behaving similarly to MARTINIZE) may be used to generate initial coordinates to use with existing CG topologies such as the MARTINI lipid models.
For instance, a pre-equilibrated atomistic membrane may be used to create starting coordinates for a MARTINI membrane simulation.

PyCGTOOL makes it easy to test multiple variations in mapping and bond topology by making simple changes to the config files.

## Install

PyCGTOOL requires Python 3.6 or higher and may be installed using pip:
```
pip install pycgtool
```

### MDTraj on macOS

On some versions macOS, with some versions of the Clang compiler, MDTraj may fail to load GROMACS XTC simulation trajectories.
If you encounter this issue, make sure you have the latest version of MDTraj.

For more information see [MDTraj/#1572](https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj/issues/1572).

## Usage

Input to PyCGTOOL is an atomistic simulation trajectory in the form of a topology (e.g. PDB, GRO, etc.) and a trajectory file (e.g. XTC, DCD, etc.), along with two custom files: MAP and BND.
These files provide the atomistic-to-CG mapping and bonded topology respectively.

Example files are present in the [test/data](https://github.com/jag1g13/pycgtool/tree/master/test/data) directory.
The format of these files is described in the [full documentation](https://pycgtool.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html).

For more information, see [the tutorial](https://pycgtool.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorial.html).
It is important to perform validation of any new parameter set; a brief example is present at the end of the tutorial.

For a full list of options, see the [documentation](https://pycgtool.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html) or use:
```
pycgtool -h
```

### Generate a Model

To generate a CG model from an atomistic simulation:
```
pycgtool <topology file> <trajectory file> -m <MAP file> -b <BND file>
```

### Map Only

To use PyCGTOOL to convert a set of atomistic simulation coordinates to CG coordinates:
```
pycgtool <topology file> -m <trajectory file>
```

Or to convert a complete simulation trajectory:
```
pycgtool <topology file> <trajectory file> -m <MAP file>
```

If you experience problems using PyCGTOOL or wish to see a new feature added please [open an issue](https://github.com/jag1g13/pycgtool/issues/new) or submit a PR.

To help develop PyCGTOOL, you can create a fork of this repository, clone your fork and install PyCGTOOL using:
```
poetry install
```

This will install PyCGTOOL in editable mode (similar to `pip install -e .`) along with all the necessary runtime and development dependencies.
The Makefile at the root of the repository contains targets for running unit and integration tests (`make test`) and linting (`make lint`).
